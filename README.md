## üñãÔ∏è How it works
- It first webscrappes the entire page from Fitgirl Repacks based on the provided game name, it will then fetch the magnet URL and automatically download using webtorrent.
- If the user prefers other alternatives to download games, there are 8 JSON files and magnet URIs provided by various websites, such as: Xatab, GOG, DODI, Online-fix.me & more.
